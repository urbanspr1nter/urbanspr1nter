### Hi there üëã

I'm currently a Software Developer working on frontend web development at **Microsoft**. 

Presently, I work on JavaScript-based rich text editors for the web browser. üìù

I have also been a **full-stack** and **backend developer** at various points in my career. Some of the work I've done included working service buses to deliver pharmaceutical data between heterogenous computer systems, working in the nitty gritty of relational databases, optimizing rendering performance of low-end mobile devices, building cloud services, and designing integrations and dashboards on the web.

Some of the technologies I am familiar with at a professional level are:

‚û°Ô∏è **Languages**: JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Python, C#, VB.NET

‚û°Ô∏è **Frontend Frameworks**: Node JS, React, Next JS

‚û°Ô∏è **Databases/Stores**: MySQL, MongoDB, Postgres, Redis

Additionally, I have experience in the following tools

‚û°Ô∏è **Operating Systems**: Linux, macOS, Windows

‚û°Ô∏è **Bundlers**: Webpack, Vite

‚û°Ô∏è **Editors**: vim, VS Code

‚û°Ô∏è **Virtualization**: VMWare vSphere/ESXi, Microsoft Windows Hypervisor, Proxmox
